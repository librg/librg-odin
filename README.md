# odin-librg

Odin binding for librg framework.
Written for **3.0.5** version. Binding doesn't support librg compiled with `LIBRG_THREADING` enabled.

**NOTE:** This repo is out-of-date and requires updating to the latest Odin's version. However, due to my time constraint, I am not able to perform such an action. If you're willing to update it, I'd be happy to assist and accept any changes.

## Dependencies

* [odin-enet](https://github.com/zpl-c/odin-enet) (static library not needed)
* librg static library

## Things to note

* Some methods are inconvenient to use, further simplification in process.
